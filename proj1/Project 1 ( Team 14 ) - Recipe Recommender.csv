Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others,2,2 of the team members contributed to the most of the commits and changes count  https://github.com/thosaniparth/Recipe_Recommender/graphs/contributors
Number of commits,1,Commits and branching model is followed properly
Number of commits: by different people,2,2 major contributors are present
Issues reports: there are many,1,There aren't many issues only 19 issues all together till now
Issues are being closed,2,Closed 16 Issues and only have 3 open issues
DOI badge: exists,3,Lot of badges have been used
"Docs: doco generated, format not ugly",0,Docs link in readme is not working https://github.com/thosaniparth/Recipe_Recommender/blob/master/docs/Recipe%20Recommender%20Source%20Documentation.pdf
Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation),1,Just screenshots not much of explanation
"Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z",2,Screenshots added for few use cases
"Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing",1,needs more interactive and improved UI with enhanced user experience
"Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.",3,https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25223347/140403709-a062e7c5-4500-49d4-9758-aea9e5fa5442.mp4
Use of version control tools,3,Proper useage of git
Use of style checkers,1,UI project Doesn't have a proper eslint checker config file https://github.com/thosaniparth/Recipe_Recommender/tree/master/Code/frontend
Use of code formatters.,1,No Formatter configs mentioend in the settings of yml files but only present in workflow
Use of syntax checkers.,2,Synxtax checkers are being used in both backend and frontend projects
Use of code coverage,2,Unit tests are added but the coverage is pretty low and no test build in CI/CD setup
Other automated analysis tools,1,"There isn't any automated build added in github workflows, only formatters are added"
Test cases exist,3,https://github.com/thosaniparth/Recipe_Recommender/blob/master/Code/backend/__tests__/test.spec.js
Test cases are routinely executed,1,Its in workflow but there isn't any automated flow
The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up,3,https://github.com/thosaniparth/Recipe_Recommender/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
Issues are discussed before they are closed,1, just have an automated bot responder https://github.com/thosaniparth/Recipe_Recommender/issues/8
Chat channel: exists,0,chat channel for the project is not present
Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.,2,
