Follow these instructions to set up this bot on your end in just a few minutes:

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Start a terminal session in the directory where the project has been cloned. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. In the directory where this repo has been cloned, run the following command to execute a bash script to run the Telegram Bot:

## Configuring Email Credentials for SMTP: Sending Emails from Your Account

**SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** is a standard protocol for sending emails. It is widely used for sending email messages from one server to another. In the code, we are using SMTP to send emails via a Gmail account. Here's how the SMTP configuration and usage work:

1. **SMTP Server**: The `smtp_server` variable is set to 'smtp.gmail.com,' which is the SMTP server for Gmail. This server is responsible for sending your email messages.

2. **SMTP Port**: The `smtp_port` variable is set to 587. This is the port for TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption. Gmail uses this port for secure email communication.

3. **SMTP Username**: The smtp_username variable should be set to your own Gmail email address from which you want to send the emails. Make sure to replace `your-email@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail email address in the code. This ensures that the emails will be sent from your specific Gmail account.

4. **SMTP Password**: The `smtp_password` variable is set, you need to generate an "App Password". An App Password is a 16-character code that allows you to access your Gmail account without revealing your real password. To generate an App Password, follow these steps:

   - Go to your Google Account settings (https://myaccount.google.com/).
   - In the "Security" section, under "Signing in to Google", select "App Passwords".
   - Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)" from the dropdown menus.
   - Click "Generate".
   -  Google will provide you with a 16-character App Password. Use this as your `smtp_password` in your code.

By customizing these settings, you can send emails from any email account using SMTP. Just ensure you are adhering to the security guidelines provided by your email provider.

### Testing

We use pytest to perform testing on all unit tests together. The command needs to be run from the home directory of the project. The command is:

```
python run -m pytest test/
```

(OR)

```
python -m pytest test/
```


### Code Coverage

Code coverage is part of the build. Every time new code is pushed to the repository, the build is run, and along with it, code coverage is computed. This can be viewed by selecting the build, and then choosing the codecov pop-up on hover.

Locally, we use the coverage package in python for code coverage. The commands to check code coverage in python are as follows:

```
coverage run -m pytest test/
```

```
coverage report
```


## Usage

We have tried to make this application (bot) as easy as possible. It's pretty self-explanatory. You can use this bot to manage and track your daily expenses and not worry about losing track of your expenses. As we have also given in functionality for graphing and plotting and history of expenses, it becomes easy for the user to track expenses.

## Configuration

As a user, there's no need to configure any parameters. As a contributor, we have tried to make the system as decoupled as possible so that changes to one module/program don't affect other ones. With this being said, here are some configuration knobs that we have exposed for contributors:
1. Adding categories,
2. Removing categories,
3. Graphing changes,
4. Changing Telegram bot names, etc.
