"Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)",3,evidence in GH

"Docs: doco generated, format not ugly",3,in GH
Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation),3,
"Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z",3,doc page entries
"Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing",3,
"Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.",3,
Use of version control tools,3,
Use of style checkers,3,config files in GH showing your config
Use of code formatters.,3,config files in GH showing your this formatter's config
Use of syntax checkers.,3,config files iin GH showing this checker's config
Use of code coverage,3,config files in GH
Other automated analysis tools,3,config files in GH
Test cases exist,3,dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base
Test cases are routinely executed,1,E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something
The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up,3,
Issues are discussed before they are closed,3,"even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here"
Chat channel: exists,3,Link or screenshots
Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.,3,"If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it"
Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files,3,
"Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)",3,
"Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)",3,
Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base,2,
Short release cycles,3,(hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work
